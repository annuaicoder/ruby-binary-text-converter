# Ruby Input to Binary Converter

This Ruby script converts user input into its binary format. It supports both numbers and text inputs, converting them to binary representation and returning the result.

## Features
- Converts text input to binary format based on ASCII values.
- Converts numeric input to binary using standard binary representation.

## Installation

### 1. Ruby Installation
Ensure that Ruby is installed on your machine. You can verify this by running:

```bash
ruby -v
```

If Ruby is not installed, follow these instructions:

- **macOS**: Ruby is pre-installed. If you want to upgrade or install a specific version, use a Ruby version manager like `rbenv` or `rvm`.
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: Install Ruby with:
  
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install ruby-full
  ```

- **Windows**: Download the Ruby installer from [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/).

### 2. Clone the Repository
You can clone this repository or create the Ruby script file manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/annuaicoder/ruby-binary-text-converter
cd ruby-input-to-binary-converter
```

### 3. Execute the Script
To run the script:

```bash
ruby main.rb
```

The program will ask you to enter either a number or text, and it will return the binary representation of your input.

## Usage

### Example Execution

```bash
$ ruby binary_converter.rb
Enter a number or text to convert to binary: Hello
Binary format: 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111
```

If you input a number:

```bash
$ ruby binary_converter.rb
Enter a number or text to convert to binary: 42
Binary format: 101010
```

## How it Works

- **For text input**: Each character is converted to its ASCII value and then to binary, ensuring an 8-bit binary format.
- **For numeric input**: The number is directly converted into its binary representation using Ruby's built-in `.to_s(2)` method.
